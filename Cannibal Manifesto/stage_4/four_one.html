What clashed with the truth was clothing, that raincoat placed between the inner and outer worlds. The reaction against the dressed man. American movies will inform us.

 Children of the sun, mother of the living. Discovered and loved ferociously with all the hypocrisy of saudade, by the immigrants, by slaves and by the touristes. In the land of the Great Snake.

It was because we never had grammars, nor collections of old plants. And we never knew what urban, suburban, frontier and continental were. Lazy in the mapamundi of Brazil. A participatory consciousness, a religious rhythmics.
            We want the Carib Revolution. Greater than the French Revolution. The unification of all productive revolts for the progress of humanity. Without us, Europe wouldn't even have its meager declaration of the rights of man. The Golden Age heralded by America. The Golden Age. And all the girls.Montaigne. Natural man. Rousseau.We're tired of all the suspicious Catholic husbands who've been given starring roles. Freud put an end to the mystery of Woman and to other horrors of printed psychology.
